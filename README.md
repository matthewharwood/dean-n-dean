# dean-stack

A rapid-prototyping platform for browser games, optimized for live iPad-over-LAN iteration. Static-only deploy to GitHub Pages, all state in IndexedDB, and a single `bun run check` that gates every change.

> Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the architectural spec — the *why* behind every constraint here. This README is the **operator's manual**: how to install, develop, test, build, deploy, and review.

## The Four Pillars (non-negotiable)

Every change in this repo is judged against these four rules. Anything that violates one is **reverted, not patched**.

1. **Storybook-first** — a component does not exist until a sibling `*.stories.tsx` does. Build the smallest piece in isolation; compose into routes.
2. **Zod-first types** — every prop, atom value, IDB record, env var, and route param starts as `z.object({...})`. The TS type is `z.infer<typeof Schema>`. Hand-written types that mirror a schema are forbidden.
3. **IDB-first state** — IndexedDB is the source of truth; Jotai is its in-memory cache. A single root `<Suspense>` calls `use(idbHydrationPromise)` once at startup; after that, every `atomWithIDB` reads synchronously.
4. **CLI-gate-first** — `bun run check` runs `biome ci → stylelint --max-warnings 0 → tsgo --noEmit → bun test → playwright test`. **Any** warning is a failure.

## Stack at a glance

| Layer | Tool | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime / package manager | Bun | `1.3.13` (pinned via `packageManager`) |
| Tooling runtime | Node | `25` (`.nvmrc`) |
| Monorepo orchestrator | TurboRepo | `2.x` |
| Language | TypeScript | `7` via [`@typescript/native-preview`](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) — the Go-based `tsgo` compiler; replaces `tsc`. Strict mode + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` + `verbatimModuleSyntax`. |
| Framework | TanStack Start | SPA + full prerender (`@tanstack/react-start`) |
| Build engine | Nitro | `v3` (used internally by `@tanstack/react-start`'s prerender pipeline) |
| UI | React | `19` (Compiler enabled) |
| Styling | Tailwind | `v4` (CSS-first via `@theme`) |
| Animation | anime.js | `v4` (named imports only) |
| Canvas / 2D rendering | PixiJS | `8.18.1` — first-party for all canvas-based UI. Mounted via the `usePixiApp(canvasRef, setup, deps)` hook in `app/canvas/`. Same side-channel discipline as anime.js: render stays pure; all `Application.init` / `Ticker` / sprite mutation lives in `useEffect`; `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` short-circuits Ticker animations. See the 24 `pixijs-*` skills under `.agents/skills/` for the full API surface. |
| State | Jotai | `2.x` (parameterized atoms via the `atomWithIDB` key + a module-scope `Map<id, atom>`; `selectAtom` from `jotai/utils` for derived per-id slices — dean-stack does not use `atomFamily`) |
| Persistence | IndexedDB via `idb` | `8.x` |
| Validation | Zod | `4` |
| Env | `@t3-oss/env-core` | client-only on Pages |
| TS / JS lint + format | Biome | `2.x` |
| CSS lint | Stylelint + Tailwind plugin | `16.x` |
| Component dev | Storybook | `10` (Vite builder) |
| PWA | Vite PWA + Workbox | latest |
| Unit tests | `bun:test` | bundled with Bun |
| Browser tests | Playwright | `1.59+` |
| Local agent orchestration | OpenAI Symphony | Reference runner cloned to ignored `tmp/symphony/`; workflow/spec package in `packages/symphony-first-five`; run with `bun run symphony` or `bun run dev:symphony`. |

## Prerequisites

This repo pins both runtimes; install matching versions before anything else.

### 1) Node 25 — toolchain only, never the app runtime

The repo's **`.nvmrc`** pins Node 25. CI reads it (`actions/setup-node@v4` with `node-version-file: ".nvmrc"`); locally, install Node 25 with **nvm**:

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
node -v   # should print v25.x.x
```

> The only Node-version pin in this repo is `.nvmrc`. Don't add `.tool-versions` or a `"volta": {...}` block in `package.json` — `.nvmrc` + the `packageManager` field already pin everything; a second pin format is two sources of truth waiting to drift.

> Node only exists for tools that refuse to run on Bun. The app itself **never** executes on Node — the deploy target is GitHub Pages (static). Don't introduce a Node server.

### 2) Bun 1.3.13 — runtime, package manager, and unit-test runner

Bun is pinned via the root `package.json`'s `packageManager` field. Install:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

Verify:
```bash
bun -v    # should print 1.3.13
```

### 3) (Once) Playwright browser binary

Playwright runs against a real Chromium. Install the binary once per machine:
```bash
bunx playwright install chromium
```

CI installs this in the workflow.

---

## First-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/dean-stack.git
cd dean-stack

bun install                              # installs every workspace; creates bun.lock
bunx playwright install chromium         # browser binary (one-time per machine)
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env   # local env file
```

Open `apps/web/.env` and confirm `VITE_GAME_TITLE` is set (the committed default `dean-stack` is fine for development).

> The text lockfile **`bun.lock`** is committed. The older binary form `bun.lockb` is gitignored. Don't commit it.

> Workspace-internal deps use the `workspace:*` protocol — never a published version range. Bun creates symlinks under `node_modules/@dean-stack/*` so Biome, Stylelint, and TS can extend the shared configs.

---

## Local development

```bash
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` invokes `turbo run dev`, which co-runs every persistent task in the resolved app workspace via Turbo's `with` co-runner. `apps/web` is selected by default while it exists; use `DEAN_APP=<name>` for a generated app.

| Task | URL | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | `http://localhost:5173` | Vite dev server (TanStack Start in SPA mode) |
| `storybook` | `http://localhost:6006` | Storybook (component construction surface) |
| `biome:watch` | (terminal) | Lints `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` / `.json` on save |
| `stylelint:watch` | (terminal) | Lints `.css` on save |

The watchers print findings in the terminal — **the IDE is not the source of truth** and may not be running.

To run Symphony alongside the same dev stack:

```bash
bun run dev:symphony
DEAN_APP=my-new-game bun run dev:symphony
```

Edit `apps/web/app/components/<name>/index.tsx` — its sibling `index.stories.tsx` lights up immediately. Edit `apps/web/app/styles/index.css` — Tailwind tokens regenerate live. Add a route under `apps/web/app/routes/` — TanStack Router regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` automatically.

> While developing, watch the **browser console**. A Zod runtime error in dev is a Pillar-2 contract failure — fix it before continuing, same as a TS error.

### react-scan — the React Compiler diagnostic

[`react-scan`](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) is loaded automatically in **Storybook** dev (`.storybook/preview.tsx` imports it behind an `import.meta.env.DEV` guard, so it tree-shakes out of the prod bundle). It outlines components that re-render with a highlighted box.

> **Not loaded in the app dev server.** react-scan v0.5.x patches React 19 in a way that breaks TanStack Router's `HeadContent` (`useContext` returns null at the head-render boundary). Storybook avoids the issue because it doesn't render `HeadContent`. Until the incompatibility is resolved upstream, do component-level re-render diagnostics in Storybook.

**Use it.** When you suspect a render issue — interaction feels janky, animation restarts unexpectedly, a Pixi canvas re-mounts, anything that "looks wrong" — open the route or story in your browser, perform the interaction, and look at the highlighted boxes. A box on a component that shouldn't have re-rendered is a real bug — usually:

- A side-channel violation (anime.js / PixiJS call leaking into render)
- An unstable atom return (a new object identity each `get` instead of a stable reference)
- A missed React Compiler optimization (a Component-defined-inside-Component, a non-pure render, etc.)

**Fix the cause, not the symptom.** Manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `React.memo` is forbidden in dean-stack (the React Compiler handles memoization — see `.agents/skills/react-compiler-rules/SKILL.md`). Suppressing the highlight by adding manual memo defeats the diagnostic.

react-scan has no version-specific deprecations, no opinionated patterns, no migration cliffs — there is intentionally **no skill for it**. Just look at the boxes; fix what's bad.

### Running watchers individually

If you want to focus on a subset:

```bash
# from apps/web/
bun run dev               # Vite dev only
bun run storybook         # Storybook only
bun run biome:watch       # Biome lint watcher only
bun run stylelint:watch   # Stylelint watcher only
```

---

## The CLI gate — `bun run check` and `bun run check:fast`

Two flavours of the same gate. **Any warning from any stage is a failure.**

| Command | Chain | When |
|---|---|---|
| `bun run check` | `biome ci → stylelint → tsgo → bun test → build → playwright (storybook + app + app-offline)` | CI, and any time you want full release-quality verification locally |
| `bun run check:fast` | `biome ci → stylelint → tsgo → bun test → playwright --project=storybook` | Pre-push hook, and the inner-loop "is it green yet" check |

`check:fast` skips the `app` and `app-offline` Playwright projects because they spin up `vite preview` against `dist/` — without a fresh build they validate yesterday's bytes. Those are CI's job. The `storybook` project drives `storybook dev`, which is HEAD-valid every run, so it's safe to gate locally.

```bash
bun run check         # full gate
bun run check:fast    # pre-push gate (also auto-runs on `git push`)
```

If either is red, **stop the current task, fix it, and re-run until green** before proceeding.

### Pre-push hook

`bun install` runs the `prepare` script which invokes `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh` — that writes a one-line `.git/hooks/pre-push` that `exec`s `bun run check:fast`. No package dependency, no Bun-postinstall friction. Bypass intentionally with `git push --no-verify` (e.g. pushing a WIP branch you intend to clean up before opening the PR).

### What each stage owns

| Stage | Tool | Owns | Skipping rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` | `biome ci` | `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` / `.json` (Biome's CSS linter is **off** — Stylelint owns CSS) | Don't disable a rule to get green. Fix it. |
| `stylelint` | `stylelint --max-warnings 0` | `.css` only — knows Tailwind v4 directives via `@dreamsicle.io/stylelint-config-tailwindcss` | Don't blanket-ignore `@theme` / `@apply` — install the plugin. |
| `typecheck` | `tsgo --noEmit` | type-check only; emit is Vite's job | Don't `as`-cast at module boundaries — parse with Zod. |
| `test:unit` | `bun test` | pure logic — schemas, atom reducers, IDB migration transforms, parsers | Don't reach for `happy-dom` — DOM tests belong in Playwright. |
| `test:e2e` | `playwright test` | browser-tier — story tests + app workflows + offline deep-link | Don't `test.skip` to make CI green. |

### Skipping rules — when never to skip

- **Don't `--no-verify`** on git hooks. The hook runs the same gate.
- **Don't `// biome-ignore`** without a rule path *and* a justification.
- **Don't disable `--max-warnings 0`** in CI. Fix the warning.

---

## Local testing

Two layers, partitioned by what they need:

### Unit tests — `bun test`

Fast, no browser. Use it for **anything that doesn't need a DOM**: pure functions, Zod schema edge cases, atom reducers, IDB migration *transform functions*, parsers, derived selectors.

```bash
bun test                              # full run (part of the gate)
bun test apps/web/app/state           # path filter
bun test -t "rejects negative"        # name filter
bun test --watch                      # local inner loop
bun test --coverage                   # coverage report
```

Tests live next to their source: `derive.ts` ships with `derive.test.ts` in the same directory. Never split into `__tests__/`.

> **No ASK FIRST is needed for `bun test`** — write unit tests directly when the logic is unit-testable.

### Browser tests — `playwright test`

Three projects, three responsibilities, three test-name suffixes:

| Project | File suffix | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storybook` | `*.story.spec.ts` | `localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=...` | Mount a story, assert visible state, ARIA, IDB contents |
| `app` | `*.app.spec.ts` | `localhost:3000` (preview) | End-to-end route workflows (interact → reload → verify) |
| `app-offline` | `*.offline.spec.ts` | `localhost:3000` (preview) | Offline deep-link contract — the load-bearing PWA test |

```bash
bun run test:e2e                                       # all projects
bun run test:e2e -- --project=app                      # app only
bun run test:e2e -- --project=app-offline              # offline only
bun run test:e2e -- --project=storybook --grep @smoke  # smoke subset
bun run test:e2e -- --ui                               # interactive Playwright UI
```

Stack-wide rules baked into `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Reduced motion forced on** at the project level (`use: { reducedMotion: 'reduce' }`). The `useAnime` hook short-circuits, so animations don't add flake. Override per-test only if the animation IS the assertion.
- **Real IndexedDB** — never mocked. Seed via `page.addInitScript`; read via `page.evaluate`.
- **Fresh IDB per test** is the default fixture (`auto: true`).
- **Web-first assertions only** — `await expect(locator).toBeX()`. Never wrap point-in-time methods inside `expect()`.
- **`bun run preview` is the target**, not `bun run dev`. Vite dev does not register the production SW.

### **ASK FIRST** before writing any Playwright test

This is load-bearing per Pillar 4. Before writing or modifying *any* Playwright test, surface the structural choices to whoever owns the feature:

1. Story-level vs app-level vs offline?
2. What to assert: visible text, ARIA, screenshot, IDB contents, network calls?
3. Selector strategy: role > test-id > text?
4. IDB state: fresh, or seeded with what?
5. Network: online, throttled, offline?
6. Reduced motion: forced (default) or no-preference?

Calcifying these without consultation is a Pillar violation. Wait for the answer, **then** write the test.

---

## Build & preview

```bash
bun run build       # vite build (TanStack Start invokes Nitro for the static prerender)
bun run preview     # serve the build at http://localhost:3000
```

What `bun run build` does, in order:

1. **Validates env at build time.** `vite.config.ts` does `import "./app/env"` as a side effect; a `ZodError` here aborts the build before any artifact is uploaded.
2. **Vite bundles the SPA** — React 19, the React Compiler, Tailwind v4.
3. **TanStack Start prerenders every route** with `prerender.failOnError: true` — a missing route fails the build.
4. **Workbox writes `sw.js`** precaching the shell.
5. **Build script** copies `index.html` → `404.html` (GH Pages's SPA fallback), `touch`es `.nojekyll` (insurance against Jekyll stripping `_`-prefixed paths), then runs `scripts/build-sitemap.ts` to walk the prerendered HTML and emit `sitemap.xml` keyed off `VITE_SITE_URL`. The artifact lands at `apps/web/dist/client/`, with `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `og-card.svg`, and `sitemap.xml` alongside `index.html`.

Use `bun run preview` to verify locally — that's the same artifact GitHub Pages serves. Playwright `app` and `app-offline` projects run against this preview server, **not** the dev server.

---

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Two GitHub Actions workflows:

- **`.github/workflows/check.yml`** — runs `bun run check` on every push and PR.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** — on push to `main`, builds and uploads the artifact, deploys to Pages.

### One-time GitHub repo setup

1. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.**
2. **Settings → Environments → `github-pages`** — created automatically by the deploy workflow on first run.
3. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** — add `VITE_GAME_TITLE` and the SEO contract (`VITE_SITE_URL`, `VITE_SITE_DESCRIPTION`, optionally `VITE_OG_IMAGE`, `VITE_AUTHOR_NAME`, `VITE_AUTHOR_URL`, `VITE_TWITTER_HANDLE`). Defaults are baked into the workflow for `VITE_SITE_URL` (computed from `github.repository_owner`/`github.event.repository.name`) and `VITE_SITE_DESCRIPTION`, so the minimum-viable deploy works without setting any vars — but override `VITE_SITE_URL` to your custom domain if you have one.
   - Values here are **public** — they ship in the JS bundle.
   - **Never** put a real secret in a `VITE_*` field. If you need a private key, GitHub Pages is the wrong target — surface the constraint, don't introduce a server.

### What the deploy workflow does

```yaml
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      app:
        description: "App to publish (folder name under apps/)"
        default: web
        type: string

env:
  APP: ${{ github.event.inputs.app || vars.PAGES_APP || 'web' }}

steps:
  - actions/checkout@v4
  - actions/setup-node@v4   (with .nvmrc)
  - oven-sh/setup-bun@v2    (reads packageManager pin)
  - id: pages
    uses: actions/configure-pages@v5            # emits the canonical base_path
  - run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
  - run: bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium
  # Pillar 4 — gate runs BEFORE the prod build so we never deploy code
  # that fails lint/types/unit/e2e. check.yml is PR-only; this is the
  # only CI surface that runs on push to main (no parallel workflows).
  - run: bun run check
  - name: Build ${{ env.APP }}
    env:
      BASE_PATH: ${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}
      VITE_GAME_TITLE: ${{ vars.VITE_GAME_TITLE }}
    run: bun run build --filter=@dean-stack/${{ env.APP }}
  # build script handles cp index.html→404.html and touch .nojekyll
  - actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 (path: apps/${{ env.APP }}/dist/client)
  - actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

**Which app gets published.** `inputs.app` (workflow_dispatch) → `vars.PAGES_APP` (repo variable) → `'web'` (default). Push triggers always pick up `vars.PAGES_APP` or fall back to `web`; `workflow_dispatch` lets you override per-run from the Actions UI.

**Base path is env-driven, not hardcoded.** `actions/configure-pages@v5` outputs `base_path` — `/<repo>` for project pages (`<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`), `/` for user/org pages (`<owner>.github.io`), and `/` for custom domains. The workflow exports that as `BASE_PATH`, and `vite.config.ts`'s `resolveBase()` normalizes it (adds the trailing slash Vite needs). Local dev: `BASE_PATH` is unset → `/`.

### Custom domain or user/org pages

Configure the custom domain in **Settings → Pages**. `actions/configure-pages@v5` will then emit an empty `base_path`, `BASE_PATH` is unset in the build env, and `resolveBase()` returns `/`. No code change required.

### Verifying the live deploy

After the first successful deploy, smoke-test in this order:

1. **Online cold-load** — open the project URL in a fresh browser, confirm the home route renders and the SW installs.
2. **Hard refresh** — confirm the SW serves the shell from cache instantly.
3. **Offline deep-link** — DevTools → Network → Offline → load `<URL>/games/maze/3` directly. Confirm Level 3 renders.

If step 3 fails, the offline contract is broken — see `apps/web/tests/maze-deep-link.offline.spec.ts` for the regression test that should have caught it locally.

---

## Architecture — the offline deep-link contract

The single most important flow: **a kid hitting a deep URL while offline must boot the SPA from cache, hydrate from IDB, and render — with no server round-trip**. Lose this and the iPad-over-LAN scenario breaks.

> **Editing this diagram?** Mermaid's sequence-diagram parser treats `+`, `;`, and `<` followed by a letter (e.g. `<LevelCard ...>`) as syntax tokens inside message and note text — *not* literal characters. Avoid those, then validate with `bunx --bun @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i diagram.mmd -o out.svg` before pushing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Kid as Kid (iPad, offline)
    participant SW as Workbox SW
    participant Bundle as Vite bundle
    participant Router as TanStack Router
    participant Suspense as Root Suspense
    participant IDB as IndexedDB (idb)
    participant Atom as atomWithIDB
    participant Persist as persist.ts
    participant Channel as BroadcastChannel

    Note over Kid,SW: First visit was online, so SW and shell are precached.

    Kid->>SW: navigate /games/maze/3
    SW-->>Kid: precached index.html via navigateFallback
    Kid->>Bundle: parse shell, evaluate JS
    Bundle->>Suspense: import side-effect kicks off idbHydrationPromise
    Bundle->>Router: createRouter, mount RouterProvider
    Router->>Suspense: __root renders, use(idbHydrationPromise)
    Suspense->>IDB: openDB(dean-stack, v2)
    IDB->>IDB: upgrade callback runs cumulative migrations
    IDB-->>Suspense: connection ready
    Suspense->>IDB: getAll(progress), get(settings)
    IDB-->>Suspense: raw rows
    Suspense->>Suspense: Zod safeParse rows, set resolvedSnapshot

    Router->>Router: ParamsSchema.parse coerces level to 3
    Router->>Atom: read getProgressAtom for id maze-3
    Atom->>Atom: lazy resolveCurrent, snapshot miss returns fallback
    Atom-->>Router: Progress id=maze-3 level=1 completed=false
    Router-->>Kid: render LevelCard with URL level=3, atom completed=false

    Note over Kid,Channel: Kid taps Complete, write-through path.

    Kid->>Atom: setProgress with completed=true
    Atom->>Atom: ProgressSchema.parse(next), Pillar 2 contract
    Atom->>Atom: update in-memory storage atom
    Atom->>Persist: call persistProgress(value)
    Persist->>Persist: schedule with 150ms debounce, key progress:maze-3
    Persist->>IDB: db.put(progress, value)
    IDB-->>Persist: write committed
    Persist->>Channel: postMessage on dean-stack:idb
    Channel-->>Kid: other tabs and Storybook iframe re-hydrate
```

Four load-bearing properties this diagram encodes:

- **No network.** Steps 1–3 use only the SW's precache. The router resolves `/games/maze/3` client-side and never asks a server — that route is *not* in the prerender list, so Workbox's `navigateFallback: "/index.html"` (with a denylist that excludes `/assets/*`, image/font extensions, and `/sw.js`) hands back the canonical shell and the router takes over from there.
- **Single Suspense, eager hydration.** `idbHydrationPromise` is a top-level IIFE in `apps/web/app/state/hydration.ts` — step 4 is the *import* side-effect kicking it off, not a function call. By the time `__root.tsx` calls `use(idbHydrationPromise)` (step 6), `openDB` is usually already pending. After `resolvedSnapshot` is populated (step 12), every `atomWithIDB` resolves its initial read synchronously via `getHydratedSnapshot()` — no per-atom suspense, no waterfalls.
- **Two-stage URL → state resolution.** Step 14 (`ParamsSchema.parse`) coerces the URL segment to a typed `level: number` via `z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(99)`. Step 16 returns the atom's `fallback` (`{ id, level: 1, completed: false }`) because IDB is empty on a cold offline boot — the rendered `LevelCard` displays `level=3` from the URL and `completed=false` from the fallback, even though no progress row exists yet. Writing one (step 19) creates it.
- **Parse on every set, debounced write-through.** Step 20 is Pillar 2 in action — `ProgressSchema.parse(next)` inside `atomWithIDB`'s setter (`apps/web/app/lib/atom-with-idb.ts:36`). An invalid set throws and propagates to the root `errorComponent`. Steps 22–24 isolate IDB writes from React's render pipeline: `persist.ts` schedules a 150ms timer per key (`progress:maze-3`), coalescing rapid taps into a single `db.put`, then posts `{ store, key }` on the `dean-stack:idb` BroadcastChannel so other tabs and the Storybook iframe re-hydrate. The value itself is *not* on the channel — the receiver re-reads from IDB, keeping IDB the single source of truth (Pillar 3).

This contract is verified end-to-end by `apps/web/tests/maze-deep-link.offline.spec.ts` — currently `.skip`'d pending the Workbox / TanStack-Start `_shell.html` rename ordering fix (see [Known gaps](#known-gaps)).

---

## Scaffolding new apps

Add a new dean-stack app — same toolchain, same Pillars, same gate — with the TurboRepo generator at `turbo/generators/config.ts`.

```bash
bun gen:app                                    # interactive prompt for the name
# or, equivalent:
bunx turbo gen run app                         # interactive
```

The generator asks for a kebab-case name (e.g. `test-project`), then scaffolds `apps/<name>/` from `turbo/generators/templates/app/`:

- Full toolchain wiring (Vite + TanStack Start + Tailwind v4 + Storybook + Playwright + Biome + Stylelint)
- Symphony task wiring (`symphony` workspace script) so generated apps work with `bun run symphony` and `bun run dev:symphony`
- Pillar-3 state plumbing (db, hydration, persist, atomWithIDB, migration test)
- Pillar-2 helper (`defineComponent`)
- Motion plumbing (`useAnime`, presets, engine defaults)
- One seed component (`HealthCard`) with co-located story and Playwright story test
- A skipped offline shell test (re-enable once SW generation is wired)

After scaffolding:

```bash
bun install                                    # symlinks the new workspace
bun run check                                  # runs the gate across every app
```

The generator templates substitute `{{name}}` everywhere it matters: `package.json`'s `@dean-stack/<name>`, the IDB database name, the `BroadcastChannel` name, the PWA manifest, the `index.html` `<title>`, the `vite.config.ts` `base` path for project pages, and the default `VITE_GAME_TITLE` in `.env`.

Root app-targeted commands resolve the app workspace through `scripts/resolve-app-filter.ts`: `apps/web` is the default while it exists; if `web` is deleted and only one generated app remains, that app is selected automatically. Use `DEAN_APP=<name>` or `DEAN_APP_FILTER=@scope/name` when multiple apps exist:

```bash
DEAN_APP=my-new-game bun run dev
DEAN_APP=my-new-game bun run dev:symphony
DEAN_APP=my-new-game bun run check:fast
```

Symphony itself is repo-level. Keep the reference runner under ignored `tmp/symphony/` and local Linear credentials under ignored `.symphony/secrets.env`; generated apps reuse `scripts/run-symphony.ts` and `packages/symphony-first-five/WORKFLOW.md`.

> The repo's deploy workflow (`/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) currently builds and uploads `apps/web` only. To deploy a generator-scaffolded app, either point the workflow at the new app's `dist/client/` or add a parallel workflow per app.

## Code review checklist

Every PR is reviewed against the Four Pillars. Anything that violates one is reverted, not patched.

### Pillar 1 — Storybook-first

- [ ] Every new `*.tsx` component has a sibling `*.stories.tsx`?
- [ ] Stories are co-located with the component (no `__stories__/` parallel tree)?
- [ ] No component was built at the route level first?
- [ ] Storybook config (`viteFinal`) re-uses `vite.shared.ts` — not forked?

### Pillar 2 — Zod-first types

- [ ] Every component prop schema is a `z.object`?
- [ ] No hand-written TS type that mirrors an existing Zod schema?
- [ ] Boundary parses use `safeParse` / `parse` — no `as` casts at module boundaries?
- [ ] No `any` — `unknown` + Zod parse instead?
- [ ] Components use `defineComponent(schema, fn)` so dev parses and prod tree-shakes?

### Pillar 3 — IDB-first state

- [ ] Persistent state goes through `atomWithIDB`, never `useState`?
- [ ] Only one `<Suspense>` boundary uses `use(idbHydrationPromise)` (root)?
- [ ] No per-atom suspense?
- [ ] Schema bumps include a migration test (`bun test`)?
- [ ] The service worker doesn't touch IDB?

### Pillar 4 — CLI-gate-first

- [ ] `bun run check` is green locally?
- [ ] Every Playwright test was preceded by an ASK-FIRST round?
- [ ] No rule disabled, no `// biome-ignore` without a justification, no `test.skip`?

### React Compiler purity

- [ ] No manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `React.memo`?
- [ ] No anime.js or PixiJS call inside render — both are side channels; all `animate()`, `new Application()`, `Ticker.add(...)`, sprite mutation, and DOM/canvas reads live inside `useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect` / event handlers?
- [ ] No `ref.current = ...` during render?
- [ ] Every animation site uses `useAnime` (anime.js) or `usePixiApp` (PixiJS) — both short-circuit on `prefers-reduced-motion`?

### TanStack Router boundaries

- [ ] `__root__.tsx` declares `errorComponent` and `notFoundComponent`?
- [ ] `router.tsx` wires `defaultErrorComponent` and `defaultNotFoundComponent`?
- [ ] `RouteError` re-throws when `typeof window === "undefined"` so prerender's `failOnError` aborts on real bugs?
- [ ] `app/router.test.ts` still passes — the four wirings are gate-asserted, not a convention?
- [ ] A new game route declares its OWN `errorComponent` for level-tight recovery (root is the safety net, not the first line)?

### PWA contract

- [ ] Workbox `navigateFallback` still points at `/index.html`, denylist still excludes asset URLs?
- [ ] No new precache entry for per-route data (assets only)?
- [ ] No fetch from inside the service worker?

### Deploy hygiene

- [ ] Any new `VITE_*` env var is added in `apps/web/app/env.ts` *and* in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`'s `env:` block?
- [ ] No entries in `app/env.ts`'s `server: {}` slot (GH Pages is static)?
- [ ] Any new prerendered route is reachable via `<Link>` from another prerendered page (so TanStack Start's `crawlLinks` picks it up) or listed in the `tanstackStart({ prerender: { routes: [...] } })` array?

### SEO and social

- [ ] Any new top-level route declares its own `head` returning `buildSeoLinks({ path })` so a single `<link rel="canonical">` renders (root no longer emits canonical — see `apps/web/app/lib/seo.ts`)?
- [ ] Per-route titles or descriptions go through `buildSeoMeta({ path, title, description })` so OG and Twitter Card tags update in lockstep with the page title?
- [ ] No raw `<meta>` JSX in components — head injection is route-level via TanStack Router's `head` callback, not React tree?
- [ ] `tests/seo.app.spec.ts` still passes — the SEO contract is gate-asserted, not a convention?

## Known gaps

The gate runs green today, but three Playwright tests are explicitly `test.skip`'d with documented reasons. They mark contracts that are real but blocked on upstream wiring:

- **`tests/shell.offline.spec.ts` and `tests/maze-deep-link.offline.spec.ts`** — the PWA offline contract. `vite-plugin-pwa`'s `closeBundle` hook runs **before** TanStack Start's prerender renames the SPA shell from `_shell.html` to `index.html`, so no `sw.js` lands in `dist/client/`. Fix: a post-prerender Workbox step (probably a custom Vite plugin invoking Workbox after the rename), or adopt `injectManifest` mode and write the SW by hand. Re-enable once `dist/client/sw.js` lands.
- **`tests/maze-level.app.spec.ts`** — clicking the Complete button calls `setProgress(...)` on the parameterized `getProgressAtom(id)` atom, the schema parses, IDB write is scheduled, but the `LevelCard` keeps showing the "Complete" button branch instead of the "Completed" badge. The atom's stored value flips internally; the consuming `useAtom` doesn't observe the new value until a remount. Confirmed independent of the family layer (un-skipped after the parameterized-atoms rewrite that replaced `jotai-family` with module-scope `Map<id, atom>` memoization, and the test failed identically). Suspect the SENTINEL-to-resolved transition inside `atomWithIDB`'s lazy-read pattern. Re-enable once `atomWithIDB`'s read path is fixed.

Both are tracked as test-skip annotations in-tree; remove the `.skip` once the underlying fix lands.

## Troubleshooting

**`tsgo --noEmit` fails with `routeTree.gen.ts` errors after a fresh `bun install`.**
The committed stub has `@ts-nocheck` and is regenerated on `bun run dev`. Run `bun run dev` once, let the TanStack Router plugin overwrite the file, then re-run `bun run check`.

**Playwright `app-offline` test fails locally but passes in CI (or vice versa).**
The offline test runs against `bun run preview`, **not** `bun run dev`. Vite dev does not register the production SW. Stop dev, run `bun run build` then `bun run preview`, and re-run `bun run test:e2e -- --project=app-offline`.

**Biome can't resolve `@dean-stack/biome-config/biome.json`.**
Run `bun install` so workspace symlinks land in `node_modules/@dean-stack/`. If it still fails, swap to a relative extends in `biome.json`: `"extends": ["./packages/biome-config/biome.json"]`.

**`prerender.failOnError` aborts the build with a missing route.**
Add the route to the `tanstackStart({ prerender: { routes: [...] } })` array in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`, or ensure a `<Link to="...">` from a prerendered page reaches it (`crawlLinks: true` will pick it up). Don't set `failOnError: false` — the missing route is the bug.

**Stylelint flags `@theme` / `@apply` / `@import "tailwindcss"`.**
The Tailwind plugin (`@dreamsicle.io/stylelint-config-tailwindcss`) isn't installed or `stylelint.config.mjs` isn't extending `@dean-stack/stylelint-config`. Re-run `bun install`.

**A Zod parse fails in the dev browser console.**
That's a Pillar-2 contract failure of the same severity as a TS error. Fix the schema or the input — never silence the throw.

**`bun.lockb` shows up in `git status`.**
You're on an old Bun version that wrote the binary lockfile. Upgrade to Bun ≥ 1.2 and delete `bun.lockb`. The text `bun.lock` is the only committed lockfile.

**`bun run check` fails on `tsc` because of T3 env's generic types.**
`isolatedDeclarations` is intentionally **off** in `packages/tsconfig/base.json` until the env wiring is annotated. If you've turned it on locally, turn it off or annotate the `env` export explicitly.

**Storybook builds but Tailwind classes don't apply in stories.**
The Tailwind plugin is in `vite.shared.ts` and Storybook re-uses it via `viteFinal`. If classes are missing, somebody forked the Vite config in `.storybook/main.ts` and added `@tailwindcss/vite` separately, which double-runs the plugin. Remove the duplicate.

**`bun run dev` says "no tasks were found" or watchers don't start.**
Each watcher is a Turbo task with `with: ["dev"]` in `turbo.json`, paired with a script in `apps/web/package.json`. If you've renamed one without updating the other, Turbo can't pair them. Check both files match.

**Storybook Playwright tests fail with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on the first run after a `bun install`.**
Vite cold-prebundles new dependencies the first time Storybook starts. The Storybook `webServer` in `playwright.config.ts` has `timeout: 180_000` (3 min) to cover this, but a parallel-worker race against the prebundler can still surface as connection refused. Re-run `bun run check` once — the second run hits the warm prebundle cache and goes green. This is the documented "retry once on infra flake" rule (Pillar 4).
